    <h2>More About My Passion</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>
        Through my dance and music experiences, I’ve learned that the arts are not just hobbies but a means of 
        self-expression and connection with others. Dance, especially, has pushed me out of my comfort zone and 
        allowed me to explore different aspects of myself. Indian Classical dance, with its precision and grace, 
        has taught me discipline and storytelling, while hip-hop and fusion have encouraged me to let loose and 
        experiment with new movements. The fusion of these styles excites me—there's something empowering about 
        blending tradition with modernity and creating something new and unique every time I step onto the dance 
        floor. My performances are not just about choreography, but about how the music and how the movements come 
        together to tell a certain story and evoke emotion within the audience.
        <br>
        Music, on the other hand, has become a newfound passion that keeps me grounded. Whether I’m playing bass 
        or piano, there’s something deeply personal and fulfilling about creating sound and being part of something 
        bigger—whether it’s with my set on stage or if it’s a random jamming session with my friends. I love learning 
        new instruments and performing for live audiences. It has challenged me in the best way possible, forcing
        me to adapt and grow. I’m definitely still learning and growing–I shy away from lead vocals because it’s 
        such a vulnerable task to put all my emotion through my voice. It’s much easier for me through dance. Both 
        dance and music allow me to continually evolve, and I can’t wait to see where these creative journeys take 
        me next.
