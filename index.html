      Hi! My name is Sonal, and welcome to my personal website/blog. I am a 3rd year Computer Science and Finance major
      at Northeastern University, but in my free time I enjoy dance and music.  
      Here, I plan to share my performances and new art events I plan to attend, including dance showcases,
      open mic nights, and music festivals. 
      As a dancer, I am trained in Indian Classical dance, but I enjoy branching out into new styles of hip hop
      and fusion by attending dance workshops in Boston and at Northeastern.
      I usually try to attend workshops hosted by NEBC and Revolve. At Northeastern, I love performing in Dance 4 
      and other Asian showcases in the Spring. Below is a picture of me in a showcases from last spring.
      As a music artist, I enjoy performing back up vocals, playing piano, and playing bass. 
      I'm more new to this, and only started performing music as a freshman in college, but I've had the opportunity
      to play piano for many pop songs, and bass on some super fast bass songs. My last bass performance was on 
      campus for a big event hosted in Curry Ballroom.
      Other than that, I really enjoy attending music festivals, concerts, and other showcases. I try to go to festivals
      in the summers, especially Boston Calling, or other festivals near Texas, Virginia, and Nashville. I think the 
      South has a really interesting musical culture, filled with more folsky and jazzy songs, where as nearby,
      there's usually a mix of genres depending on the theme of the music event.
      I also try to go to a mix of large and small concerts. A few of my friends perform at local bars and restaurants in
      the Boston area, and I enjoy supporting them, but I also love going to MGM Fenway for the occasional big concert.
      Overall, music and dance are two huge passions of mine, and I welcome you on my journey of artistic exploration
      at my time in Boston.
